## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

Government of Punjab

## Theme
Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development

## Proposed Solution
 Localized crop advisory based on soil, weather, and crop stage.
 Multi-channel delivery – SMS, IVR (voice), and mobile app in local language.
 Farmer profiling – land size, crop type, and preferences for personalized advice.
 Pest & disease alerts with low-cost management practices.
 Guidance on irrigation & fertilizer use to reduce costs.
Market linkage support – price updates and collective selling via FPOs.
 Community knowledge hubs with trained local volunteers.
Feedback system – farmers’ inputs improve future recommendations.


Do you want me to make this into a project-style format (Problem → Solution → Benefits) so you can use it in a report or submission?
## Technical Approach
System Design: Hybrid model (digital + offline support).

Data Sources: Weather APIs, soil data, crop calendars, market prices.

Decision Engine: Rule-based/AI models for crop-specific, location-based advice.

Advisory Delivery: SMS, IVR (voice in local language), mobile app/chatbot for smartphone users.

Farmer Profiling: Registration with details (land size, crops, soil type).

Feedback Loop: Farmer responses improve accuracy of future advisories.

Scalability: Start with SMS/voice → later add IoT sensors & advanced AI tools.

## Feasibility and ViabilitY
Feasibility
Technical: Works on basic phones (SMS/IVR), scalable with apps/IoT.

Operational: Easy to use, local-language support, backed by FPOs/NGOs.

Social: Farmers more open to digital tools, trust builds via local demos.

Economic: Low-cost setup, reduces crop loss, increases income.

Viability
Short-term: Needs support from govt/CSR for pilot phase.

Long-term: Sustainable via low subscription (₹20–30/month) or FPO collective model.

Scalable: Once developed, easy to expand regionally with local content.

Impact-driven: Improves yield, lowers costs, ensures better market access.

## Impact and Benefits
Here are the impact and benefits of a small crop advisory system for marginal farmers in short points:
 Improved crop yield through timely, localized guidance.
 Reduced input costs by advising on optimal fertilizer, water, and pesticide use.
 Better crop planning with weather- and soil-based advisories.
 Risk reduction against pests, diseases, and climate variability.
 Easy access to knowledge via SMS/voice in local languages.
 Inclusion of small & illiterate farmers through voice-based advisory.
 Community empowerment via farmer groups and FPOs.
 Market linkage with real-time price updates, leading to higher income.
 Promotion of sustainable practices (organic inputs, water saving).
